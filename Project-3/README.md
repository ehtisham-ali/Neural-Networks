# Regularization

Problem-1 "Dropout Regularization"
In this project I  implemented feed-forward network using only Numpy with Dropout Regularization technique. 


Problem-2 "Early Stopping"
Implemented Feed Forward Neural Network using only Numpy with Early Stopping Regularization technique



Problem-3 "Data Augmentation"
While the performance of neural networks can significantly increase with increasing training data size, collecting a large dataset is hard and needs a lot of work in annotation. Therefore, data augmentation is a widley used technique in machine learning to artificially increase your training set size. In case of images, data augmentation methods can be scaling, rotations, cropping, or mirroring. In this exercise, we will get familiar with some of these techniques and apply them on the MNIST fashion dataset
