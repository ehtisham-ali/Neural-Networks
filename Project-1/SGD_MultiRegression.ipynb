    "**Important:** For all implementations in this project, make sure to use NumPy whenever possible. Most computations on vectors and matrices can be implemented very efficiently using the NumPy API. There is no need for looping over vectors etc. As a simple example, in order to compute the mean of a vector, just use `numpy.mean()`. If you are not familiar with NumPy please consult the NumPy tutorial that you find in the CMS under *Materials*. Further, in case of any doubts, the Forum is the best place to ask questions and discuss the project.  "

    "Features are our friends for prediction. For example, knowing the weight of a person is helpful for predicting his/her height. Knowing both the weight and age may improve the accuracy of our prediction. However, too many features could harm: each feature can be thought of as a dimension, $n$ features correspond to a $n$ dimensional space. In a high dimensional space ($n$ is very large), our data will distribute sparsely: if you draw unit grids in the space, the most of them will contain no data, which obstructs the learning process. This is called the *curse of dimensionality* (for more detail about the curse of dimensionality, see [here](http://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/curse-dimensionality-affect-classification/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we simply reduce the dimensionality (i.e. reduce the number of features). We can either select a subset of all features, or we can apply PCA on our dataset. By specifying a $d$ ($d$<$n$), PCA will project our $n$ dimensional data onto a $d$ dimensional (affine) space. The assumption is that classification/regression should be easier in this $d$ dimensional space.\n",

However, a standard deviation of zero can only be possible when all the values of a feature/column are the same (all equal to the mean). In this case, those features have no discriminative power so they can be removed from the analysis. Your implementation should be able to handle this case: all columns with zero standard deviation should be removed before standardize the data."

    "## Multiple Linear Regression (15.0 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will deal with *multiple linear regression*. Performing regression on one independent (or explanatory) variable and a scalar dependent variable is called **simple linear regression**.\n",
    "But, when there are more than one explanatory variable (i.e. $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, ...,x^{(k)}$), and a single scalar dependent variable (*y*), then it's called **multiple linear regression**. (Please don't confuse this with *multivariate linear regression* where we predict more than one (correlated) dependent variable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will implement a **multiple linear regression** model in Python/NumPy using the *Gradient Descent* algorithm. Particularly, we will be using **stochastic gradient descent** (*SGD*) where one performs the update step using a small set of training samples of size *batch_size* which we will set to 64, i.e. we go through the training samples sampling 64 at a time and perform gradient descent. Such a procedure is sometimes called **mini-batch gradient descent** in the deep learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through all the training samples *once* is called an **epoch**. Ideally, the algorithm has to go through multiple epochs over the training samples, each time shuffling it, until a convergence criterion has been satisfied.\n",
